# Kwiz

Kwiz is a web application that enables the user to undertake a series of questions on different technologies. The app is user-friendly, and I shall find it extremely easy to answer the multiple-choice questions. At the end of the quiz, a result report is generated, which states the score and point in percentage(%). There is also a component for multiplayer with kwiz robot.
